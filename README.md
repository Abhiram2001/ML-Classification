Flowers-Classification Using Neural Networks

The Given Python file uses two hidden layers to classify three different types of flowers which are given in the data set (iris.csv) attachetd along with it.

you can alter the learning rate by editing the lrate Variable for changing in the accuracy.
you can alter the Hidden layer - 1 size by editing the h1size Variable for changing in the accuracy.
you can alter the Hidden layer - 2 size by editing the h2size Variable for changing in the accuracy.

It uses sigmoid function for the caluculating the change or slope for the weights.
Except numpy no other packages are used in the file.

To Install numpy use command "pip install numpy" in your cmd propmpt

Make Sure the csv file and the python file in the same directory to avoid importing Error else give the file location in importing statement.
